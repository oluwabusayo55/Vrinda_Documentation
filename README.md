### Project Title: Vrinda Sales Analysis For 2022

### Project Overview
---
This Data Analysis project aims to generate insights into the sales performance of Vrinda Store for 2022. Analysing the data received, i intend to gather enough insights to make reasonable conclusions which enables me to tell compelling stories about the data and to know the best performance from the data.

### Data Sources
---
The primary source of data used is Vrinda Store.csv and this is an open source data which can be downloaded from an open source online site such as kaggle or any data repository site.

### Tools Used
---
- Microsoft Excel [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com) 
   - For Data Cleaning
   - For Analysis
   - For Visualization
    
- Github for Portfolio Building

### Data Cleaning and Processing
---
In the intial phase of data cleaning and pprocessing, i performed the following actions;
- Data loading and Inspection
- Handling missing values
- Data cleaning and formatting
- Creation of new columns for aggregation

### Data Analysis
---
In this phase, i focused on summarizing the cleaned and processed data to identify trends, patterns and key insights. The analysis aimed at finding Monthly Sales Trends, top- performing States and Sales based on Gender. I used pivot tables to summarise sales by Category, sales by Order Status, sales by Channel and the correlation between Age group and Gender to evaluate performance. Key Insights derived include;
 - Women accounted for 64% of Sales making it top-performing Gender
 - Identified product category(set) as the best performing Product
 - March is the month that generated the highest sales.

### Data Visualization
---
In this phase, i created visuals of the data to make trends and insights easily interpretable. These visuals were designed to provide a clear view of sales and orders performance, product contributions and region trends.

By leveraging visualizations, i was able to transform raw data into actionable insights.

### Recommendations
---
Here are my recommendations for Vrinda Store in order to improve their Sales;
 - They should focus on Women's preferences to maximise their sales, as they are the primary contributors of Sales.
 - Improve product quality and customer experience to reduce returns, refunds and cancellation of orders.
 - Invest in Set category by running targeted promotions, introducing new designs within the category which generate more sales.
 - Leverage regional trends by studying the characteristics of those states that generate more sales to replicate success in underperforming states.
 - Monitor seasonal trends, like the sales peek in March to optimise inventory and marketing.
